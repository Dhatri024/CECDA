I. INTRODUCTION
The evolution of the global economy and society has
significantly impacted by artificial intelligence (AI) and
its applications, which have attracted widespread interest
throughout the world. In addition, researchers in the field
of artificial intelligence have mostly focused on a few
key areas such as classical model-based machine learning,
intelligence inspired by biology, intelligence gleaned from
large amounts of data, intelligence based on simulations
of the human mind, language sciences, intelligence based
on perception, and even in education [1]. The educational
artificial intelligence research may be broken down into
four key conceptual domains: technical basis, technolog-
ical breakthroughs, intelligent applications, and symbiotic

integration [2]. Furthermore, there has been a significant rise
on the use of sophisticated information and communication
technologies, together with computational methodologies,
within the domain of education and training. The significance
of this was emphasized by the study carried out [3], [4]. Fur-
thermore, it is expected that specialized artificial intelligence
in education (AIED) technologies, which are specifically
developed to improve learning and teaching, will have a
significant impact on the future of education.
Against this backdrop, this study employs bibliometric
analysis to present an in-depth assessment of the research
trends and important areas of interest within the field of AI
during the previous decade [5]. Many studies have shown that
the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into educa-
tional curricula is now in its nascent stages in several nations.
For instance, China is prioritizing the implementation of AI
curriculum by means of teacher education programs. In this

particular context, the main subjects of interest in the field of
artificial intelligence (AI) have received considerable atten-
tion. These subjects include machine learning, data science,
big data analysis, deep learning, and ethical issues. These
themes have been extensively examined in studies [6], [7].
The importance of the mobile computing and distributed
technologies on the development of intelligent educational
applications was thoroughly explored at the 10th Interna-
tional Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education. The
authors further propose that ‘when considering the future
trajectory of research in the domain of artificial intelligence
(AI) in education’, it becomes apparent that interdisciplinary
cooperation among specialists in computer science, statistics,
education, cognition, and robotics will be essential.
There has been a noticeable and constant increase in
academic interest across a range of fields in recent years. Sig-
nificantly, some developed countries such as US has assumed
a prominent position in scholarly papers pertaining to the
Internet of Things (IoT) in the field of education, as shown
by the study [8]. Furthermore, China is a significant force in
the field of artificial intelligence (AI) research as it pertains to
the use of this technology in the context of high school pupils.
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and robots into
the field of Library and Information Science (LIS) is con-
sidered crucial in light of the anticipated changes in skill
demands and this approach is supported by the findings of
these studies [9], [10].
AI has not only gained popularity in education but also
made substantial contributions to digital education research
through the involvement of highly engaged individual sci-
entists [11]. In addition, it is worth noting that artificial
intelligence (AI) shows promise in providing tailored advice,
assistance, and evaluation to students and instructors through-
out the educational journey. This concept has been examined
in the scholarly works [12], [13]. Although there has been
a rise in the use of AI in interdisciplinary research, there
are still challenges, potential hazards, and obstacles in the
field of education. A study highlights their multifaceted
and dynamic educational capabilities and significance of
e-learning systems in the modern society [14]. The use of
Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the field of edu-
cation has generated significant attention and discussion
among scholars and professionals, highlighting the profound
impact it may have on the educational environment. Previous
study present that ‘the advent of innovative computing tools
has facilitated the development of more enriched learning
experiences, promoted a spirit of discovery, and fostered
cooperation among learners [15]. Moreover, the incorpora-
tion of artificial intelligence (AI) technology into existing
information systems presents significant opportunities for
increasing educational results via improvement and innova-
tion. The emphasis on technology and AI in education is
evident in the study [16]. They propose that the availability
of educational resources online, the automation of tasks to
save teacher time, and the provision of learning assistance to
enhance student involvement are driving positive changes in
education.
Many studies [17], [18] have further explored the use of
information technology and computer science in the under-
disciplined research in education. Reference [19] mention
that ‘the field of information technology and computer sci-
ence has seen significant progress, which has had a lasting
impact on our everyday lives. The main research areas within
this field focus on the advancement and assessment of the
Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK)
framework, the enhancement of teachers’ technological ped-
agogical content knowledge in teacher education programs,
the utilization of TPACK across various disciplines, digi-
tal literacy, online communities, and the complex dynamics
of motivation and belief. Zou et al. [20] discuss several
dimensions and together enhance our comprehension of the
dynamic educational environment.
Therefore, many educators consider the use of AI in educa-
tion a major contributing factor in achieving excellence. The
issue of AI literacy has become a significant concern among
educational authorities worldwide as they endeavor to equip
the next generation with the essential skills and knowledge of
recent technology.
Another significant area of research identified by scholars,
involves integrating gamification and e-learning for young
learners. This emerging trend has not only heightened interest
but also fostered the development of innovative approaches
within the realm of educational research.
References [21] and [22] have identified four prominent
areas for future research, including customization, game
aspects, learner styles, and learner engagement. These themes
highlight the dynamic nature of educational approaches and
technology, emphasizing the need for more investigation in
these domains.
In addition to the ramifications, the trend of AI in education
has also turned to interest in the field of digital literacy,
particularly in relation to the incorporation of digital tech-
nology, ontology research, educational approaches pertaining
to digital literacy, and assessments of effectiveness [23]. This
interest has been particularly heightened in light of the Covid-
19 epidemic. References [24] and [25] gives useful insights
to scholars and suggests new directions for future investi-
gations. For instance, technologies-enhanced learning (TEL)
has arisen as a notable breakthrough, which has disrupted
traditional teaching and learning methods by using informa-
tion and communication technologies to improve educational
results. Reference [26] underscore the significant transforma-
tional capacity of Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) in
the context of higher education.
The studies above mentioned have highlighted that the
trend in the usage of AI in education has emerged as a
potential solution to solve the increasing issues encountered
by contemporary education systems, as shown by many aca-
demic works [27], [28]. These aforementioned issues have
specifically hindered the ability to obtain education and

engage in effective learning. The integration of artificial
intelligence (AI) into the realm of education has led to the
emergence and evaluation of novel pedagogical approaches in
various settings. Hence, it is worth mentioning that sophisti-
cated information and communication technologies, together
with computational approaches, have been used in educa-
tional and training environments.
Based on the literature reviewed above, this study focuses
on providing a comprehensive analysis of the progression of
artificial intelligence (AI) research within the realm of higher
education (HE). The study employs bibliometric analysis and
topic modeling approaches, as described by [29] to offer
insights into the changing dynamics of artificial intelligence
in the field of education.
The study aims to examine past trends, as the use of
artificial intelligence has become a crucial factor influencing
forthcoming strategic choices. According to [30] the augmen-
tation and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) skills
are of utmost importance across many study disciplines. It is
worth noting that current research has only offered a limited
understanding of the widespread use of artificial intelligence
(AI) in various areas of study.
Recently, the domain of artificial intelligence (AI) has
seen notable progressions and is positioned to revolutionize
diverse facets of human existence. It is worth mentioning that
artificial intelligence (AI) technology has begun to penetrate
the field of higher education. Many recent studies have con-
tributed to the proliferation of AI in the education sector. The
proliferation of academic papers has followed the increasing
use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in the field of
education. However, there is a gap in the literature as no
extensive investigation covering the many aspects of this dis-
cipline on a broad scope has been undertaken so far [31]. The
latest studies highlight the latest advancements and research
requirements, emphasizing the need for future initiatives that
include extensive research partnerships and thorough exami-
nations of intelligent educational strategies [32], [33]
Considering recent advancements, the main aim of this
study is to analyze patterns in publications and citations,
prominent nations and affiliations, authorship status, preva-
lent themes, thematic features, research interests, and devel-
oping trends within the area. In doing so, the study provides
a comprehensive understanding of the trajectories and conse-
quences of artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of online
learning, offering insights into global trends and identifying
potential areas for future research.
II. RESEARCH QUESTIONS
This study endeavors to delineate a holistic understanding
of the evolutionary trajectory, and research foci of AI within
the field of education technology. Guided by a rigorous aca-
demic framework, this study seeks to address the subsequent
research questions:
(1) What are the basic statistics concerning the annual
production, citation for relevant publication source and
authors?
(2) Which collaborative metrices, manifested through
nations, institutional affiliations, and scholarly contri-
butions, are discernible in this academic domain?
(3) How are the prevailing research epicenters, concen-
trated foci and nascent paradigms, as reflected in the
keyword co-occurrence networks and temporal key-
word clusters?
III. METHODS
A. BIBLIOMETRIC TOOLS AND PARAMETRIC SETTING
Bibliometrics is a widely used and ‘fast advancing tool in
the field of intelligence research, namely in the evaluation of
scientific themes’ [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. It employs
quantitative analysis, ‘correlation networks, and statistics to
examine the bibliographic and content data of papers in a
specific topic [40], [41]. Furthermore, a wide reportoire of
bibliometric studies across various fields (especially sciento-
metrics) have yielded satisfactory results through conducting
similar quantitative analysis [19], [42], [43], [44].
Therefore, this study employs Bibliometrix tool (4.0.0) for
the overall quantitative analysis of the bibliometric analysis of
AI in education. The Bibliometric tool is based on R language
and works on data extracted from Scopus, Clarivate Analytics
Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
(CDSR) and RIS Pubmed/Medline. Additionally, the study
uses of Bilblioshiny (4.0) in conjunction with Bibliometrix
for the visualization of ‘‘Authors’’ ‘‘Sources’’ ‘‘Documents’’
‘‘Clustering’’, etc. Biblioshiny is a web-interface for bib-
liometrix. It enables users to make a hands-on, code-free
bibliometric analysis, including analytics/plots for different
metrics, analysis for three structures of knowledge (K-
structures). ( https://www.bibliometrix.org/home/index.php
/layout/biblioshiny). In the workflow of Bibliometrix and
Biblioshiny, the data collected are first loaded and converted
to R data frame. Based the collected data, descriptive anal-
ysis followed by bibliometric mapping are then conducted.
Finally, Biblioshiny shows the data visualization including
conceptual structure mapping and network mapping [45].
Moreover, the study incorporated [46] VOSViewer for the
visualization and mapping. VOSViewer offers open source
solution, dedicated to the generation of intricate bibliometric
mappings. Owing to VOSviewer’s capability to ‘‘illustrate
expansive bibliometric maps with intruitive clarity’’ [47],
[48], [49]. This software offers the crafting of co-occurrence
networks and delineating country/ author collaboration met-
rices. This function ensures that the large dataset is analyzed
systematically and structures into lucid and visually com-
pelling graphs. Finally, the study incorporates CiteSpace
version 6.1 for the data handling and setting the metrics
to analyze the trends and reflected patterns in the domain
of AI in education. Citespace (6.1 R6), crafted on a Java-
based application, stands as an intricate and robust tool for
the bibliometric evaluation. Underpinned by burst detection
algorithm [50] for identification of emergent research front,
betweenness centrality [51] metric for detection of essential

paradigm shift points as well two visualization modes- - clus-
ter views and time zone views, Citespace stands out as a
composite bibliometric software well operationalizing the
focal points of ‘‘research fronts’’ and ‘‘intellectual bases’’
in information science [52]. Within its parametric configu-
rations, the three-year time slice and ‘‘pruning’’ option in
pathfinder are set while the other parameters remain default.
B. DATA SOURCE AND DATA COLLECTION
Web of Science (WOS), an all-encompassing database with
more than 15,000 journal indexes and a volume of nearly
50 million articles. Utilizing the WOS database, this study
endeavors to retrieve publication metadata pertinent to AI
education. The selection criteria are meticulously delimited
to encompass solely the ‘‘editions = Social Science Cita-
tion Index’’ only. The basic theme is articulated as ‘‘AI
in education technology’’. The expanded theme has been
designated, encapsulating terminologies such as ‘‘AI (in) edu-
cation’’ ‘‘Artificial Intelligence (in) education’’ ‘‘Artificial
Intelligence in Education (AIED) ’’ ‘‘ChatGPT’’ ‘‘Large Lan-
guage Models’’ ‘‘Open AI’’ to ensure all possible keywords
within this field are included. The chronological boundary
for this is demarcated between the years 2009-2024 whereas
linguistic parameters remain unbound. Overall, the study
found 2216 articles as per the thematic criteria from the
dataset. However, the total number of articles are reduced
to 2101 as per the setting of article types such as ‘‘Article’’,
‘‘Review Article’’ and ‘‘Review Article’’. The entire process
encompassing data collection, parametric settings and data
analysis is demonstrated in the flowchart in Figure 1.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. BASIC PUBLICATION STATISTICS
This section utilizes Bibliometrix and Bilioshiny to probe
into the basic publication statistics within the research
field of AI in education technology. Specifically, docu-
ment type distribution, annual publications/ citations, relevant
sources/authors/affiliations are to be examined meticulously
in this part. As demonstrated in Table 1, a total of 2101 docu-
ments scatter over a time span of 16 years from 2009 to 2024,
coming from 963 sources. On average, each document is cited
more than six times, and the cumulative number of references
reaches up to 78,908.
In figure 2, of the 2,101 documents, 85% are articles
and 70% sing-authored individually comprise 70%, while
the remainder are integrated into book chapters, proceedings

papers, and early access collections. In stark contrast, review
articles and book reviews make up no more than 15% of
the entire collection. Figure 3 demonstrates yearly based an
overall evolving trend from 2009 to 2023. In the first decade
starting from 2009 to 2018, the evolving line of publication
remains flat, which indicates that research in this field is at
the initial stage.
Subsequent years witness a marked ascent of publication
from 17 (2018) to 1223 (2023), with an increasing growth
rate manifest in steeper lines in the trend plot.
TABLE 1. MData Size.
Table 2 of the study shows the annual metric in Publica-
tions. Results indicate that the initial mean total citations per
article is 16.67 times, with a yearly citation of 1.11 times.
Moreover, the mean total citations per article peaks at
45.32 times the at year 2016 while the yearly mean total
citation is the greatest in 2019 (8.07). To elucidate the change
of average annual citation per year, Figure 4 shows an overall
zigzag trend, indicating that ‘‘AI in education technology’’
has garnered an increasing popularity across the years, with
the most essential research insights occur in 2019.
V. OVERVIEW OF PUBLICATION SOURCES, AFFILIATION,
AUTHORS
As one of the most tangible pattern indicates that sources,
affiliations and authors are measured jointly with relevance
and local impact. Bibliometrix calculates relevance drawing
on frequency measures including number of documents, per-
centage and fractionalized frequency. Relevance in this study
is indicated by the total amount of publications. Table 3
demonstrates the top 25 most relevant sources, affiliations,
and author relevance. The ‘Cureus Journal of Medical Sci-
ence’, a Springer Nature journal in the field of Medicine,
is the one with the most publications (101) in AI education,
followed by ‘Sustainability’ (63), an open-access journal
focusing on environmental, cultural, economic, and social
sustainability of human beings The journal that ranks 3rd is
Education and Information Technologies (49), the topic of
which is congruent with information, communication tech-
nologies and education. Moreover, the author-based metrics
h-index, g-index and m-index offer a perspective taking
into account productivity and citation impact of publica-
tion sources, affiliations and authors. Table 4 demonstrates
the top 25 journals with the greatest local impact. Inter-
national Journal Of Artificial Intelligence In Education,
Sustainability, IEEE Access,British Journal Of Educational
Technology, Education And Information Technologies are the
top 5 journals with the greatest h-index and g-index. Since

according to Table 6. Notably, China and USA are also with
the most extensive global cooperations.
2) HIGHLY CITED PUBLICATIONS
Table 7 comprises the top 25 papers with the most citations.
In bibliometric analytics, global citation score (GCS) is the
overall citations of article in WOS database while local cita-
tion score (LCS) only measures the citations in the current
collected dataset. The normalized local citation (NLCS) in
bibliometric (see Table 7) is calculated by dividing the actual
count of local citing items by the expected citation rate for
documents with the same year of publication. It precisely
measures the relative citations of various documents pub-
lished in different years. The paper with largest NLCS is
considered the most influential paper within the specified

demonstrated in Figure 3.
3) ANALYSIS OF CITED REFERENCES
Burst detection facilitates the frequency tracking of docu-
ments over a specific period of time [50]. Figure 6 shows
the top 25 references with the strongest burst strength. The
blue bar indicates the overall timespan from 2009 to 2024.
However, upon deleting three documents with unspecified
publication information, 81 documents with burst strength
are detected out of 626 references. The period in which
references appear is shown in red bar. The reference with
the strongest citation burst comes from [37] aligning with
the result provided in Figure 6. The document with the
longest citation period and the second largest citation burst
is ‘‘Exploring the impact of artificial intelligence on teaching
and learning in higher education’’ by [53] in which the future
directions and challenges of AI in higher education were
meticulously investigated.
B. RESEARCH FOCI AND TRENDS
In this section, research foci and emerging trends in the
field of AI education are examined through keyword anal-
ysis including keyword co-occurrence analysis and cluster
analysis.

Firstly, to observe the keyword co-occurrence network,
VOSviewer is utilized to plot two knowledge domain maps—
the network visualization map as well as the density visual-
ization map. In Figure 7a, the largest node in the green part
is artificial intelligence, followed by ChatGPT, representative
of a technology-oriented cluster. In the red part of the map,
keywords are primarily concerned with education. The largest

2) KEY POINTS AND RESEARCH TRENDS
Keywords are the index the research trends and key points.
How specific research topic has evolved over time is depicted
in Figure 9. The thematic evolution process in Figure 9 is
originated from [54]. The 15-years span is divided into four
periods. Artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence in
education occur in the first four-year period and span across
the whole period. In the second period, ‘‘learning analytics’’
and ‘‘educational technology’’ appear as new topic. The year
2018 to 2020 marks the bloom of AI, in which terms such
as ‘‘chatbot’’ ‘‘robots’’ emerge as hot topic. The last period
is indexed by ‘‘chatgpt’’, the large language model with its
ground-breaking impact in the field of AI and every aspect
of daily life. Technology-based terms like AI and chatgpt are
on the right side while those related to education are on the
left side, indicating that more focus on ‘‘AI in education’’
research is leaned to technology instead of education. While
from the vertical axis, ‘‘student attitudes’’ are more estab-
lished in this field than ‘‘teaching’’ and ‘‘AI literacy’’ and
‘‘chatgpt’’ is under-developed. Since the field under exami-
nation is yet to be established, no keyword fall into the third
quadrant.
Later, the burst term detection analysis is conducted by
Citespace aiming to observe the topics that have undergone
rapid changes. A total of 17 burst terms are detected. The
strength and the timespan of these burst terms are shown in
Figure 10. Following a chronological order, the first keyword
that has undergone abrupt change is ‘‘artificial intelligence
in education’’, which has the longest burst range spanning
across eight years 2009-2017). The term with the largest burst
strength is ‘‘health-care’’ from 2015 to 2017, followed by
‘‘covid-19-pandemic’’ (2015-2017). The period 2016-2023 is
marked by the AI-related technology such as deep learning,
machine learning and big data. Notably, the term ‘‘technol-
ogy’’ in general has garnered much attention starting from
2018 until now. Additionally, the strategic diagram demon-
strated in Figure 11, consisting of four quadrants, graphically
illustrates the centrality and density of keywords. The key-
words on the right side are of greater centrality or higher
degree of connection between clusters. Those on the upper
side of the quadrant are of greater density or higher degree of
connection between keywords in the cluster. Therefore, the
keywords on the first quadrant are called motor themes, which
are well-developed and bearing great significance [54].

(dsql tutor) are the initial clusters with mean citation year
of 2015 Cluster # 3 (patient education) and cluster # 12(text
mining) mark the most recent trend in this field. Additionally,
cluster #0 is the longest spanning cluster, indicating that
cyber-physical-social systems, learning analytics, deep learn-

VII. CONCLUSION
The study offers a bibliometric analysis of the AI in educa-
tion and aims to highlight the trends, and reflected patterns.
In doing so, the study shows the diversity of themes, patterns
and novel approaches to education while using AI technology
across the world. The study also shows developments in the
field of artificial intelligence in education, big data and learn-
ing analytics and offers valuable suggestions based on the
findings. This study examines the worldwide context of arti-
ficial intelligence (AI) research, specifically focusing on the
nations, universities, authors, journals, and publications that
have shown the highest levels of productivity in the area of AI
integrated with online learning between the years 2010 and
2024. The research answers these questions by highlighting
and examining a range of challenges related to the utilization
of AI in education, along with the opportunities it presents.
These challenges encompass the possibility of inappropriate
application of AI techniques, the changing roles of teachers
and students, and the ethical and social consequences arising
from the integration of AI.
Overall, the study highlights that AI is proven to be a help-
ing aid that as focused on studying and creating intelligent
machines and software capable of learning, logic, commu-
nicating, manipulating, and perceiving objects. To enhance
the usefulness, intelligence, and human-like qualities of
machines, specific application-oriented intelligent technolo-
gies have been developed for particular scenarios. Following
a chronological order, the first keyword that has undergone
an abrupt change is ‘‘artificial intelligence in education,’’
which has the longest burst range spanning eight years
(2009-2017). The term with the largest burst strength is
‘‘healthcare’’ from 2015 to 2017, followed by ‘‘covid-19-
pandemic’’ (2015-2017). The period from 2016 to 2023 is
marked by AI-related technologies such as deep learning,
machine learning, and big data. Notably, the term ‘‘technol-
ogy’’ in general has garnered much attention from 2018 until
now.
As per the mean citation year in Table 7, cluster #7 (Ameri-
can Indian) and cluster #15 (dsql tutor) are the initial clusters
with a mean citation year of 2015. Cluster #3 (patient edu-
cation) and cluster #12 (text mining) mark the most recent
trends in this field.
The results of this study have provided statistical evidences
of topics and themes, diversity in using artificial intelligence
(AI) tools and gadgets which have emerged as a highly
effective method for extracting meaningful insights in higher
education. Nevertheless, the primary objective of using AI in
education is not to acquire useable knowledge, but rather to
utilize the knowledge to facilitate the teaching and learning
process. Recently, there has been a proliferation of using
ChatGPT models and other AI tools in education.
Overall, the studies presented in this review showed that
the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of
education has achieved notable advancements, particularly in
economically advanced nations, as shown by relevant aca-
demic research [19], [55]. The influence of AI applications
within the realm of education is becoming more evident.
The transformative impact of this phenomenon is visible
in various aspects, such as the reduction of teacher work-
loads, the provision of personalized learning experiences, the
incorporation of intelligent tutoring systems, the analysis and
prediction of learner profiles, the enhancement of precision in
education, the facilitation of collaborative learning environ-
ments, and the monitoring of individual learners’ progress.
Finally, the study identifies that artificial intelligence (AI)
has a diverse range of capabilities that extend beyond the
establishment of Intelligent Learning Environments (ILEs).
Its influence on real-world teaching practices has been exten-
sively discussed [56]. The noticeable increase in scholarly
articles related to these fields in recent years indicates the
rising significance and pressing nature of these subjects.
